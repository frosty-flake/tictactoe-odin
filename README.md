# tictactoe-odin

This Javascript project for The Odin Project is a simple tic-tac-toe game. The goal of the project
is to practice using factory functions.

# reflections

- Factory functions really do make code a lot cleaner, but its abit difficult to wrap my head around still.
- The most challenging part of the project was deciding what functions to put into each object. Along those lines,
  it was unusual to have to call functions on everything (instead of just using variables). I forgot a few times
  and the code did not work.
- I learnt how to disable the functionality of buttons upon triggering events, which is useful.

# what to improve on

If I revisit this project, I will want to:
- clean up the javascript code, it still feels like it can be shorter.
- Add a check for editing names in the middle of a game.
- Add a score tracker.
